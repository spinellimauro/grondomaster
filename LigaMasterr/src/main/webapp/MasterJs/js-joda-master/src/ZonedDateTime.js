/**
 * A date-time with a time-zone in the ISO-8601 calendar system,
 * such as {@code 2007-12-03T10:15:30+01:00 Europe/Paris}.
 * <p>
 * {@code ZonedDateTime} is an immutable representation of a date-time with a time-zone.
 * This class stores all date and time fields, to a precision of nanoseconds,
 * and a time-zone, with a zone offset used to handle ambiguous local date-times.
 * For example, the value
 * '2nd October 2007 at 13:45.30.123456789 +02:00 in the Europe/Paris time-zone'
 * can be stored in a {@code ZonedDateTime}.
 * <p>
 * This class handles conversion from the local time-line of {@code LocalDateTime}
 * to the instant time-line of {@code Instant}.
 * The difference between the two time-lines is the offset from UTC/Greenwich,
 * represented by a {@code ZoneOffset}.
 * <p>
 * Converting between the two time-lines involves calculating the offset using the
 * {@link ZoneRules rules} accessed from the {@code ZoneId}.
 * Obtaining the offset for an instant is simple, as there is exactly one valid
 * offset for each instant. By contrast, obtaining the offset for a local date-time
 * is not straightforward. There are three cases:
 * <p><ul>
 * <li>Normal, with one valid offset. For the vast majority of the year, the normal
 *  case applies, where there is a single valid offset for the local date-time.</li>
 * <li>Gap, with zero valid offsets. This is when clocks jump forward typically
 *  due to the spring daylight savings change from 'winter' to 'summer'.
 *  In a gap there are local date-time values with no valid offset.</li>
 * <li>Overlap, with two valid offsets. This is when clocks are set back typically
 *  due to the autumn daylight savings change from 'summer' to 'winter'.
 *  In an overlap there are local date-time values with two valid offsets.</li>
 * </ul><p>
 * <p>
 * Any method that converts directly or implicitly from a local date-time to an
 * instant by obtaining the offset has the potential to be complicated.
 * <p>
 * For Gaps, the general strategy is that if the local date-time falls in the
 * middle of a Gap, then the resulting zoned date-time will have a local date-time
 * shifted forwards by the length of the Gap, resulting in a date-time in the later
 * offset, typically 'summer' time.
 * <p>
 * For Overlaps, the general strategy is that if the local date-time falls in the
 * middle of an Overlap, then the previous offset will be retained. If there is no
 * previous offset, or the previous offset is invalid, then the earlier offset is
 * used, typically 'summer' time.. Two additional methods,
 * {@link #withEarlierOffsetAtOverlap()} and {@link #withLaterOffsetAtOverlap()},
 * help manage the case of an overlap.
 *
 * <h3>Specification for implementors</h3>
 * A {@code ZonedDateTime} holds state equivalent to three separate objects,
 * a {@code LocalDateTime}, a {@code ZoneId} and the resolved {@code ZoneOffset}.
 * The offset and local date-time are used to define an instant when necessary.
 * The zone ID is used to obtain the rules for how and when the offset changes.
 * The offset cannot be freely set, as the zone controls which offsets are valid.

     *  import static org.threeten.bp.temporal.Adjusters.*;
     *
     *  result = zonedDateTime.with(JULY).with(lastDayOfMonth());
     * </pre>
     * <p>
     * The classes {@link LocalDate} and {@link LocalTime} implement {@code TemporalAdjuster},
     * thus this method can be used to change the date, time or offset:
     * <pre>
     *  result = zonedDateTime.with(date);
     *  result = zonedDateTime.with(time);
     * </pre>
     * <p>
     * {@link ZoneOffset} also implements {@code TemporalAdjuster} however it is less likely
     * that setting the offset will have the effect you expect. When an offset is passed in,
     * the local date-time is combined with the new offset to form an {@code Instant}.
     * The instant and original zone are then used to create the result.
     * This algorithm means that it is quite likely that the output has a different offset
     * to the specified offset. It will however work correctly when passing in the offset
     * applicable for the instant of the zoned date-time, and will work correctly if passing
     * one of the two valid offsets during a daylight savings overlap when the same local time
     * occurs twice.
     * <p>
     * The result of this method is obtained by invoking the
     * {@link TemporalAdjuster#adjustInto(Temporal)} method on the
     * specified adjuster passing {@code this} as the argument.
     * <p>
     * This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.
