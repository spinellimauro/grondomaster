/**
 * Strategy for querying a temporal object.
 * <p>
 * Queries are a key tool for extracting information from temporal objects.
 * They exist to externalize the process of querying, permitting different
 * approaches, as per the strategy design pattern.
 * Examples might be a query that checks if the date is the day before February 29th
 * in a leap year, or calculates the number of days to your next birthday.
 * <p>
 * The {@link TemporalField} interface provides another mechanism for querying
 * temporal objects. That interface is limited to returning a {@code long}.
 * By contrast, queries can return any type.
 * <p>
 * There are two equivalent ways of using a {@code TemporalQuery}.
 * The first is to invoke the method on this interface directly.
 * The second is to use {@link TemporalAccessor#query(TemporalQuery)}:
 * <pre>
 *   // these two lines are equivalent, but the second approach is recommended
 *   temporal = thisQuery.queryFrom(temporal);
 *   temporal = temporal.query(thisQuery);
 * </pre>
 * It is recommended to use the second approach, {@code query(TemporalQuery)},
 * as it is a lot clearer to read in code.
 * <p>
 * The most common implementations are method references, such as
 * {@code LocalDate::from} and {@code ZoneId::from}.
 * Further implementations are on {@link TemporalQueries}.
 * Queries may also be defined by applications.
 *
 * <h3>Specification for implementors</h3>
 * This interface places no restrictions on the mutability of implementations,
 * however immutability is strongly recommended.
 *

     * The input object must not be altered.
     * <p>
     * The input temporal object may be in a calendar system other than ISO.
     * Implementations may choose to document compatibility with other calendar systems,
     * or reject non-ISO temporal objects by {@link TemporalQueries#chronology() querying the chronology}.
     * <p>
     * This method may be called from multiple threads in parallel.
     * It must be thread-safe when invoked.
     *
     * @param {TemporalAccessor} temporal  the temporal object to query, not null
     * @return the queried value, may return null to indicate not found
     * @throws DateTimeException if unable to query
